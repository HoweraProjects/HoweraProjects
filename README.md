Greetings, I am Cliff Chiang. I simply loved coding, and in particular websites and back-end programming. Therefore, I will keep my projects open-source on this platform. I am a developer from the Howera organization. I have enthusiasm in coding, in designing and creating webpages and projects in other languages.

I know:
- C++
- Python
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- Scratch (a prank here)
- Java (Beginner level)
- Node.js (If it is separate from webpage js)

That is all. I hope you enjoy my projects. :)
